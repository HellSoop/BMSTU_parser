# BMSTU Parser

---
This project is asynchronous Telegram bot that parses channels of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, finds important posts
and notifies users.

Under the hood, it uses [neural network](https://huggingface.co/HellSoop/BMSTU_parser_model), based on
[XLM-RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base) for filtering posts, 
[Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) for parsing Telegram and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for parsing VK. Bot is powered by [aiogram](https://aiogram.dev/).
